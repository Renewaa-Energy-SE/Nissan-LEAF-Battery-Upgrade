# Nissan-LEAF-Battery-Upgrade
So you are looking to upgrade the battery in your LEAF? You've come to the right place for information and software/hardware required. Take some time to familiarize with the content.

## Read this first 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The info here applies to OEM Nissan battery packs. The software/guides do NOT support changing cells inside the battery pack (commonly known as Chinese CATL upgrade / bruteforce cellswap). If you have the latter, look elsewhere, the info here is not for you.

Start by reading all the terminology and info about what a battery upgrade, direct upgrade, paring, CAN-bridges etc. is by following this link to the wiki: https://github.com/dalathegreat/Nissan-LEAF-Battery-Upgrade/wiki

## Getting the hardware
The BatteryUpgrade software runs on both the Muxsan 3-port CAN-bridge, and on the 2-port Budget CAN-bridge. This guide focuses on the 2-port since it is the easiest to source at the moment. Here are some purchase links for both

|  Bridge version |  Purchase link |
| :--------: | :---------: |
| 3-port Muxsan | [Muxsan's Tindie store](https://www.tindie.com/products/muxsan/can-mitm-bridge-3-port-rev-25/)   |
| 2-port budget | [AliExpress "MB CAN Filter 18 in 1](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-MB-CAN-Filter-18-in-1.html?spm=a2g0o.home.search.0)   |

Note, for 2-port it has to be the BLUE PCB, the other varients are not supported.

## Software needed to flash

## Flashing instructions
### 3-port
See this video: https://youtu.be/eLcNSo2Vn6U?t=167
### 2-port
See this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LssrvVYLtp8

Flash with BridgeFlasher.exe located in software folder. The compiled .srec files are ![located in the releases section](https://github.com/dalathegreat/Nissan-LEAF-Battery-Upgrade/releases)  . For ST LINK CLI, point the exe towards the "ST-LINK_CLI.exe" located in the "STM32 ST-LINK Utility" folder that appears after installing it. Incase the BridgeFlasher.exe doesn't run, make sure you have installed [vc++ 2015 x86](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) 

This is what the BridgeFlasher.exe should look like. Press Start to flash.

Connect the ST Link V2 to the J1 ports on the PCB. It can be hard to connect dupont wires here, so I recommend getting needle pins. Pay close attention to the pin labels on the ST Link flasher, they can vary location depending on type.

7 3.3V  	- J1

Nothing 	- J2

3 GND   	- J3

2 SWDIO   - J4

6 SWCLK   - J5

## Wiring in the hardware
When installing the 2-port into the vehicle, here are the wiring instructions. Note the colors of the wires coming from the CAN bridge can vary depending on production date. It is best to go via labels from the backside of the bridge instead.

- Red wire #1 -> +12V constant (fuse with 3A)
- Red wire #2 -> +12V constant (fuse with 3A, join together with other red wire)
- CAN-1L (Purple?) -> EV-CAN Low, Green wire (battery side)
- CAN-1H (Green?) -> EV-CAN High, Blue wire (battery side)
- CAN-2L (Yellow?) -> EV-CAN Low, Green wire (vehicle side)
- CAN-2H (Blue?) -> EV-CAN High, Blue wire (vehicle side)
- Black -> Ground
- Black -> Ground

Here is an example on a 2012 LEAF:

## Troubleshooting

### Problems flashing?
If you are having problems flashing the bridge, for instance getting messages "Unable to open file!", or not being able to open the programmer app, make sure:
- Only JTAG cables are connected to the bridge
- Incase the BridgeFlasher.exe doesn't run, make sure you have installed [vc++ 2015 x86](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) 
- Try another laptop if you are having issues

### No battery info after install, showing --- on instrumentation cluster
This means no CAN data is getting thru the bridge. Make sure:
- The bridge is flashed successfully with "Programming Complete!"
- The wires are connected right for CAN H/L
- Check that the bridge has constant +12V. It needs to stay on all the time
- If the vehicle tilts hard, remove 12V battery for a few minutes before retrying

## Software needed to make changes to code
Incase you want to make changes and actually recompile the code, you will need the following IDE
- Keil uVision5

## e-nv200 notes
The 2-port CAN-bridge can also be used on the env200. It just needs to be flashed with a different software. See this repository for the .srec file: https://github.com/dalathegreat/Nissan-env200-Battery-Upgrade/blob/main/leaf-can-bridge-3-port-env200/Debug/canbridge.srec

## Dependencies üìñ
This code was made possible with the help of Muxsan and their excellent 3-port hardware. Also massive thanks to my Patreon Glen for introducing me to the 2-port alternative.

## Alternative hardware/software
There is an excellent ESP32 alternative available here: https://github.com/NismoBoy34/Esp32LeafInverterBridge
